      <h2 class="objectives">OBJECTIVES</h2>
      <p>
        The main objective of this research is to analyze, critique, and
        redesign a functional User Experience Flow, understanding what are the
        user needs and concerns when shopping on the Atlantic Superstore
        website. It may include, but not limited, the following ideas:
      </p>
      <li>
        Possibilities/alternatives to make easier to find products for people
        with dietary restrictions;
      </li>
      <li>User’s routine and the way it is related to grocery shopping;</li>
      <li>How much bad design can affect the user experience.</li>
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      <h2 class="methodology">METHODOLOGY</h2>
      <p>
        Participants were recruited through friends, family, and personal
        connections. A link to a Google Form questionnaire including 14
        questions based on shopping experiences was sent by e-mail to seven
        participants who are already engaged in online grocery shopping. They
        were be able to answer the questionnaire using their desktop or mobile
        device at home.

      <h2 class="insights">INSIGHTS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All participants were familiar with the process of online shopping,
          and most of them prefer to do it in a Desktop instead of a mobile
          device.
        </li>
        <li>
          The main concerns involve the home page, top navigation menu, and
          readability. Some participants felt confused with repeated or
          unnecessary information. The excess of promo banners was also
          mentioned.
        </li>
        <li>
          All participants demonstrated not being completely comfortable with
          the checkout process (it could have fewer page changes, selection of
          the store and delivery time) and the difficulty of finding information
          about the procedure to change a placed order.
        </li>
        <li>
          Participants mentioned that if the feature of reviews could be
          included, it would make the shopping experience more pleasant.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <h2 class="usability">ACCESSIBILITY/USABILITY ISSUES</h2>
        <p>
          Some errors were found on the website during the
          usability/accessibility evaluation, mostly related to contrast issues
          between foreground and background:
        </p>
        <img
          class="issue1"
          src="images/Research/issue 1.png"
          width="600px"

        />

          width="300px"

        <img

        <div class="issue-details">
          <img id="number1" src="images/Research/Numer1Asset 1.png" />
          <p>
            The contrast between the black colour used on the background and the
            text colour in grey makes the content unreadable.
          </p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="issue-details">

          <p>
            There are two issues in this section: the sale icon in red and
            yellow, and the thin font-style and colour of Price/g could be
            difficult to understand for those who are visually impaired.

        <h2 class="conclusion" id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>
          The Atlantic Superstore customers are looking for direct information
          and don’t like to spend time researching due to the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Users work or study full-time and want to save time to spend with
            family and friends, so online shopping is a perfect solution;
          </li>
          <li>
            They’re looking for a service that can exceed their expectations
            about delivery and if the photos demonstrate the real essence of the
            products that they will receive at home.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In this research was possible to understand that the website has some
          issues that need to be solved:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Not all users are comfortable with the flow of some processes i.e.
            checkout.
          </li>
          <li>
            The layout needs to be redesigned to provide better
            usability/accessibility experiences: better buttons and
            re-arrangement of the Menu are the key factors.
          </li>
