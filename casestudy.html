    <h2>MY DESIGN PROCESS</h2>

    <div>
      <h2>CHALLENGE</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this project was to design a web application for an online
        grocery service that was easy, quick, convenient and helped the client
        stand out from other grocery delivery services. I was the sole designer
        on this project.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>PROBLEMS TO SOLVE</h2>
      <p>
        Due to the large quantity and variety of items, online grocery shopping
        can be repetitive and tedious comparing to other online shopping
        experiences.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>EMPATHIZE</h2>
      <p>
        The first step in the design thinking process was discovering and
        determining the user’s needs, behaviours, concerns and motivations when
        interacting with the Atlantic Superstore website.
      </p>

      <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
      <p>
        The main objective of this research is to analyze, critique, and
        redesign a functional User Experience Flow, understanding what are the
        user needs and concerns when shopping on the Atlantic Superstore
        website. It may include, but not limited, the following ideas:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Possibilities/alternatives to make it easier to find products for
          people with dietary restrictions;
        </li>
        <li>User’s routine and the way it is related to grocery shopping;</li>
        <li>How much a bad design can affect the user experience;</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h2>RESEARCH PLAN</h2>
      <p>
        Participants will be recruited through friends, family, and personal
        connections. A link to a Google Form questionnaire including 14
        questions based on shopping experiences is going to be sent by e-mail to
        seven participants who are already engaged in online grocery shopping.
        They will be able to answer the questionnaire using their desktop or
        mobile device at home.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>RESEARCH COMPONENTS</h2>
      <p>User surveys</p>
      <p>User interviews</p>
    </div>
    <div>

      />
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Qualitative takeaways from questionnaire and interviews:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The main concerns involve the home page, top navigation menu, and
          readability. Some participants felt confused with repeated or
          unnecessary information. The excess of promo banners was also
          mentioned.
        </li>
        <li>
          All participants were familiar with the process of online shopping,
          and most of them prefer to do it in a Desktop instead of a mobile
          device.

      <h2>DEFINE</h2>
      <p>
        In this step, the objective was defining the customer’s motivations and
        needs. It is the key to keep the user at the centre of the design
        process and rebuild an application that satisfies user and business
        goals.

      <h2>HOW MIGHT WE QUESTIONS</h2>
      <p id="content" text-align="float: right">
        I learned from my research that people prefer to shop on a web browser
        than mobile devices. Therefore, this informed my decision to better
        improve the web experience because it was already a platform they were
        more comfortable using. Within the web experience, I wanted to
        specifically improve the product page and the check out process, and
        framed them through these ‘how might we’ statements:
      </p>
      <p>
        <quote class="hmw" id="hmw"
          >“How might we improve the check out process for users in order to
          avoid having one step per screen?”</quote
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <quote class="hmw" id="hmw"
          >“How might we reposition products on the webpage to make it
          understandable for the user?”</quote
        >

    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>LOW-FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</h2>
      <p>
        Since I got enough information about what the user’s needs are, I
        sketched out some ideas for the new user flow. A clickable prototype was
        created using InVision to test the main screens.

    <div>
      <h2>IDEATE</h2>
      <p>
        In this phase, a task flow was created to have a clear idea of the
        necessary steps that the user needs to complete a task. Also, I created
        a moodboard with design ideas based on market research data, and then
        the first wireframe was built using Sketch.

      <h2>USER FLOW</h2>

        width="1200"
        height="450"
      />
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>PROTOTYPE</h2>
      <p>
        Iterated wireframes were created in Sketch, and exported into
        prototyping applications to Figma. This digital mock-up can be tested on
        users.
      </p>
      <img
        class="flow"
        src="images/Case Study/prototype.png"
        width="1200"
        height="750"
      />
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>USABILITY TESTING</h2>
      <p>
        The iterated wireframes and prototype were tested with users in-person
        and through online, remote user testing platforms (Maze and Zoom), and
        included: click analysis, time spent on each task, and missing paths.
        During the testing, users were asked to complete three tasks based on
        the main user flows: sign up for an account, add a product to cart, then
        proceed to check out.
      </p>
      <h3>Overview and goals/Key findings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Visual sign showing that a product was added to cart is important to
          show the user that the task was completed;
        </li>
        <li>
          Users tend to look for a path to the main categories of the grocery
          store;
        </li>
        <li>
          User got lost when there are many pages on the check out processes
        </li>
        <li>The font size in some sections was too small.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Solutions</h3>
      <p>
        Based on quantitative and qualitative data from remote usability
        testing, the following modifications were implemented:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Re-arrangement of the department section on the home screen, so that
          it would align with user’s mental models and help ease navigation;
        </li>
        <li>
          A shortcut in small buttons redirecting to the most searched
          categories were created;
        </li>
        <li>Notification to show that the user logged;</li>
        <li>
          Notification created to show that a product has been added to cart;
        </li>
        <li>The checkout process in one screen.</li>
      </ul>
      <img
        class="flow"
        src="images/Case Study/testing.png"
        width="1000"
        height="800"
      />
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>VISUAL DESIGN</h2>
      <p>
        Following the brand attributes and design, the original colour palette
        and typography were kept. Product images have been standardized. I
        worked in Sketch and Illustrator to create buttons, icons, and colour
        palette.
      </p>

    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>KEY LEARNINGS</h2>
      <p>
        To my understanding, a clear layout of information and a well-structured
        user flow motivates the user to stay focused and move towards a
        goal. The success of the user flow was measured as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Performed A /B tests for buttons;</li>
        <li>
          Heat map analysis and time spent on task data collected with Maze;
        </li>
        <li>Usability tests with users were made through Zoom.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>In this project I learned:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The benefits that good user research can bring to a product or
          service;
        </li>
        <li>
          UX Design doesn’t mean perfection, it means meeting user needs and
          expectations;
        </li>
        <li>
          User Interview and Usability tests are the most important steps and
          are also the opportunity to find out the insights that will help you
          in the improvement process.
        </li>
        <li>
          I was able to see myself growing along with the project, and exploring
          all the methods learned in class.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
      <p>
        Based on a user-centred study, this is my first project focused on
        UX/UI. Understanding the user's real pains and needs, I redesigned the
        Atlantic Superstore mobile website in order to guide the user to
        complete a task successfully.
